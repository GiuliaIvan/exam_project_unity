  artifactName: Letter to a Distant Knight
  description: "Origin: England, c. 1380 CE\r\n\r\nA personal letter penned by a
    noblewoman to her lover, a knight away on campaign. Written in Middle English
    with poetic flourishes, it speaks of dreams, longing, and war. The seal bears
    a rose \u2014 now cracked but still red with time.\r\n \r\n\rDid You Know?\r\n-
    Noblewomen were often educated scribes, writing in both Latin and vernacular.\r\n-
    Love letters were frequently coded to avoid scandal.\r\n- Some historians believe
    this letter was never sent."
