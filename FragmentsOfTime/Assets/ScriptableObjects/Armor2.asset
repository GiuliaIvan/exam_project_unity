  description: "Origin: Europe, 13th\u201315th centuries\r\n\r\r\nWorn by medieval
    knights in battle and ceremony, this steel shell could weigh up to 25\u201330
    kg. It was crafted to protect without limiting movement \u2014 and made knights
    look like walking legends.\r\n\r\nDid You Know?\r\n\r- Helmets had narrow slits
    to protect eyes \u2014 but knights often lifted them to breathe.\r\n- Some suits
    were personalized with family crests or hidden messages.\r\n- Jousting armor
    was even heavier \u2014 built just for sport!"
