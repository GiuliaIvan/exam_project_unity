  description: "Origin: France, c. 1220 CE\r\n\r\r\nThis ornate scroll contains royal
    laws issued by King Louis IX, known for justice and fairness. The script is gold-leafed,
    surrounded by painted scenes of court trials and village life. It once hung in
    the town square, read aloud to all.\r\n \r\n\rDid You Know?\r\n\r- Public laws
    were often sung or performed aloud so everyone could understand.\r\n- This scroll
    includes one of the first bans on trial by combat.\r\n- The ink was made from
    oak gall and iron salts \u2014 almost immortal."
