  description: "Origin: France/Germany, 8th\u20139th century\r\n\r\nA legendary crown
    said to have been worn by Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor. Gold, jewels,
    and enamel tell stories of kingship and divine rule. Later emperors wore it during
    coronations for over 500 years.\r\n\r\nDid You Know?\r\n\r- It was kept in a
    vault in Aachen Cathedral for centuries.\r\n- The crown is asymmetrical \u2014
    some say on purpose, to show humility.\r\n- Napoleon dreamed of stealing it to
    crown himself."
