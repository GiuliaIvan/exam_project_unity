  description: "Origin: Wales, c. 1250 CE\r\n\r\nCrafted from sacred yew wood and
    wrapped in wolf leather, this bow was used by a hidden order of forest guardians
    \u2014 protectors of borders and wildlife. Light but deadly, its arrows flew
    faster than the eye could track.\r\n\r\nDid You Know?\r\n\r- Longbows could pierce
    armor from 150 meters away.\r\n- Archers trained from childhood \u2014 some even
    slept with their bows.\r\n- Legend says this one never missed a moving target
    under moonlight."
