  description: "Origin: Scandinavia / Germany, 9th\u201311th centuries\r\n\r\r\nA
    rare Viking sword made with such pure steel that scientists were stunned. \u201C+ULFBERHT+\u201D
    is engraved on the blade \u2014 likely a brand or signature. Owning one meant
    power, status\u2026 and cutting-edge (literally) tech.\r\n\r\nDid You Know?\r\n\r-
    These swords were made with steel so strong it wouldn't be matched for another
    800 years.\r\n- Only around 170 have ever been found.\r\n- Some are fakes \u2014
    early medieval knockoffs!"
