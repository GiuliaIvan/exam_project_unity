  description: "Origin: Ireland, c. 800 CE\n\r\r\nAn ancient book of gospels, created
    by monks on a remote Irish island. Every page glows with intricate artwork \u2014
    swirls, animals, and secret symbols \u2014 painted with ink made from plants,
    stones, and even beetles.\r\n\nDid You Know?\r\n- It\u2019s written in Latin.\r\n-
    Some letters are so decorated they look like miniature mazes.\r\n- Scholars believe
    it was never meant to be read \u2014 but seen."
