  description: "Origin: Germany, c. 1150 CE\r\n\r\nBelonging to Hildegard of Bingen,
    a mystic, healer, and composer, this staff was used during her walks through
    the abbey gardens where she gathered herbs and spoke of visions. Intricately
    carved with vines and stars, it was said to glow faintly during her trances.\r\n\r\nDid
    You Know?\r\n- Hildegard wrote books on medicine, nature, and theology \u2014
    centuries ahead of her time.\r\n- Her visions were once considered divine messages.\r\n-
    This staff may have doubled as a teaching tool for her nuns."
